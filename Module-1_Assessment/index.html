        <p class="aboutme">Hello, my name is Andrew Reeves and I am currently trying to find a job in the field of computer science. I am 27 years old and am currently living in Palos Verdes Estates, California which is a suburb of Los Angeles. I went to college at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Indiana and studied electrical engineering, but later left because I realized that electricl engineering was not for me and starting over in a new major would be too expensive to continue at that school. I then got my Associates degree in liberal studies at a small school in Putney, Vermont called Landmark College. After that I moved back to Los Angeles and got my Bachelors in computer science at California State University, Doiminguez Hills. </br > </br>I have a cat named Major, he is very cute, but he can be kinda mean sometimes. Major is short for Majordomo because he runs the place. In my spare time I like to play video games, mostly World of Warcraft. You can find me on the classic server Whitemane, Kurb, Orc Warlock. Hit me up for some battle grounds.</p>
